Code	Description
L2X	log2-transform
RMN	row median normalization
SSN     subset normalization
SF#	filter out samples where less than # of the data is non-NaN (i.e. SF8 = 80% probes present = passing)
PF#	filter out probes where less than # of the data is non-NaN (i.e. PF8 = 80% samples present = passing)
LLB	linear-optimization load balancing, based on minimizing distance to median sample
OF#	outlier sample filtering, if sample is far away from median even after load balancing operations (# sd away from mean distance)
MPR     manual probe rejection, probes manually selected for rejection by user are filtered out
